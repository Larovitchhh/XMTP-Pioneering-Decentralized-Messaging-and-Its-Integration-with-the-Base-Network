XMTP's relationship with Base exemplifies the synergy between decentralized messaging and scalable blockchain infrastructure. Base identities are explicitly supported by XMTP as a social ID type, allowing users to leverage their Base-linked wallets for secure messaging.

The pivotal integration came in 2025, when XMTP was relaunched as a core feature in Coinbase's Base App (formerly Coinbase Wallet). Previously an experimental opt-in tool, XMTP now provides native, end-to-end encrypted messaging directly within the app, transforming it from a simple wallet into a "super app" for on-chain social, financial, and communication experiences.

 Users can now send encrypted DMs, transfer USDC mid-conversation, and interact with AI agents or mini-appsâ€”all powered by XMTP's protocol. 

This partnership was bolstered by Ephemera (XMTP's developer) raising $20 million in Series B funding in July 2025, achieving a $750 million network valuation. The funds support XMTP's mainnet launch and deeper Base integration, positioning it to onboard millions via Coinbase's user base.

 Community discussions on X highlight how this elevates Base App into a unified platform for Web3 interactions, with agents like Rocky enhancing event-based group chats.
