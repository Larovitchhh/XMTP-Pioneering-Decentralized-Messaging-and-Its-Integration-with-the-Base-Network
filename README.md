XMTP: Pioneering Decentralized Messaging and Its Integration with the Base Network
XMTP, or Extensible Message Transport Protocol, is a decentralized messaging network designed to enable secure, censorship-resistant communication in the Web3 ecosystem. Launched as an open-source protocol, XMTP allows developers to build applications featuring group chats, direct messages (DMs), and notifications without relying on centralized servers. Its core mission is to empower users with ownership over their conversations, making messaging portable across apps and blockchains. With over 2 million connected identities and integration into more than 60 production apps, XMTP has positioned itself as a foundational layer for Web3 communication.

At its heart, XMTP operates as a network of nodes that relay and store encrypted messages off-chain, ensuring scalability while maintaining blockchain-derived identities. This setup allows for end-to-end encryption using the IETF-standard Messaging Layer Security (MLS) protocol, which provides perfect forward secrecy and post-compromise security. The protocol's audited implementation has been vetted by security firms, making it suitable for enterprise-grade applications trusted by wallets like Coinbase Wallet and MetaMask.
